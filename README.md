# Pong-Game
I built this game using an online tutorial which can be found here:
www.http://breakout.enclavegames.com/

The entire code stack is available on git hee:
https://github.com/end3r/Gamedev-Canvas-workshop.git

I think it is important to note that I did not copy and paste the code from the tutorials "compare code" option, nor did I simply clone the project from the authors git. I actually used the tutorial and keyed the code into my local workspace which is managed with the visual studio code app.

After each of the ten lessons I reviewed the compare code option to debug any errors because they were times when I was missing characters or had the code ordering out of alignment with the authors version. In cases like this I did cut and paste the code to place it in the correct area but this is code that was inside my local ide.

My plan:

I know the suggestion was to make a simple Simon type of memory game but I felt I would have more fun with pong instead of the simon game since I am old enough to remember what pong was. I owned an atari pong game console when I was a young boy growing up in the seventies, so it brings back some memories as well.

As part of my interactive milestone project I plan on using the Pong-Game skeleton I pushed to git titled "my first commit" as a template. My plan includes improving the game by completing each of the ten recommended exercises the tutorial challenges you to do, after each of its ten lessons.

I am hoping this qualifies for grading purposes because there are no links to these additional exercises and the code produced and or altered would be provided by me exclusively. I agree some of the early exercises are simply editing code already known to me but as you get further and further into the lessons you are actually having to create new functions which means  new variables, new functions related to those variables and of course calling to them once you have them figured out.

These improvements include the following exercises:

1. Change the size and color of the given shapes.
 - Changed the brick height to half original
 - Changed brick color type to rgb
 - Changed brick color to random
 - Changed score and lives color to black
 - Added 7 additional lives
 - Added 9 new rows
 - Added 5 new columns
 - Decreased the brick padding to half original
2. Change the speed of the moving ball, or the direction it moves in.
3. Change the color of the ball to a random colour every time it hits the wall.
4. Make the paddle move faster or slower, or change its size.
5. Make the ball move faster when it hits the paddle.
6. Change the number of bricks in a row or a column, or their positions.
7. Change the color of the ball when it hits the brick.
8. Add more points per brick hit, print out the number of collected points in the end game alert box.
9. Adjust the boundaries of the paddle movement, so the whole paddle will be visible on both edges of the Canvas instead of only half of it.
10. Change the number of lives and the angle the ball bounces off the paddle.

I will commit each time I finish an exercise.

Added features.
Once I complete my first goal which is to improve the logic based on the ten exercises listed above, I plan on adding additional features such as...

1. Make responsive so there is paddle functionality in responsive states below ipad's display size.
2. Increase game score to infinite instead of 15
3. Log high scores

Technical notes:

Built in the first commit version

1. Create the Canvas and draw on it
2. Move the ball
3. Bounce off the walls
4. Paddle and keyboard controls
5. Game over
6. Build the brick field
7. Collision detection
8. Track the score and win
9. Mouse controls
10. Finishing up
