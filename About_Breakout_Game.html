          <div class="history">
                <p><h4>Breakout was spawned from the original pong game. It was a two player video game styled after the popular table top version of the game ping pong. An engineer by the name of Nolan Brushnell had this idea of  turning the traditional muti-player game pong into a single player game. Gameplay would consist of the player maipulating the direction of the ball with a paddle. The ball would collide with bricks removing them one by one as the ball collided with them.</h4></p>
                    <p><h4>The trick to the game was to not allow the ball to by pass the paddle and hit the bottom wall. If this occured a game life was forfieted.</h4></p>
                        <p><h4>The game itself was designed by one of the founders of Apple Steve Wazniac, who was hired by and partnered with Steve Jobs for the project. As the story goes, Steve Jobs was asked  by Brushnell if he could convert his breakout game idea into a working prototype. Jobs agreed and promptly enlisted his friend and co-worker Wazniak to help produce the game. It took all of four days at a cost to Atari of $4,750.00</h4></p>
